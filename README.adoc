Example of possible swagger/openapi documentation

Reproducing it:

Run the application:

 ./gradlew run

See the generated swagger documentation:

 curl localhost:8080/api-docs/swagger/swaggerdemo-0.0.yml

Expected the property name  `petName` should have been `pet_name` due to the `@Schema( name = "pet_name")` annotation
on the `Pet` class.

== Usage

Post a pet:

  curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/pet/ -d '{ "pet_name":"Swagger Bug"}'

See generated swagger yml

 curl localhost:8080/api-docs/swagger/swaggerdemo-0.0.yml
