Example of possible swagger/openapi documentation

Reproducing it:

Run the application:

 ./gradlew run

See the generated swagger documentation:

 curl localhost:8080/api-docs/swagger/swaggerdemo-0.0.yml

Expected the property name  `petName` should have been `pet_name` due to the `@Schema( name = "pet_name")` annotation
on the `Pet` class.
